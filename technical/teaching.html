    <h2>Guest Lectures</h2>

    <p style="font-size:100%;" align="justify"> During my graduate studies, I had the privilege of delivering several guest lectures, which greatly enhanced my ability to engage with students and present confidently in front of large audiences. Two of the key talks I gave were for CprE 558 - <a href="../files/Real-time.pdf" target="_blank">Real Time Systems</a> and CprE 539 - <a href="../files/Real-time2.pdf" target="_blank">Cyber-Physical System Security for the Smart Grid</a>. These experiences were instrumental in refining my teaching skills.
